# 👋 Hi there, I'm Isa!

With a background in Business Administration and Marketing, I bring a strategic mindset and strong communication skills to the world of software development. My journey began by managing SaaS platform communities, where I developed a deep understanding of user behavior and digital engagement. This experience sparked a passion for creating web experiences, and ultimately led me to become a developer.

Today, I'm a full stack developer with a love for frontend work and a sharp eye for detail. I build thoughtful, user-centric solutions that not only look good and function seamlessly, but generate meaningful data for better decision-making. Currently, I’m part of a tech squad creating tools that help marketing teams attract and convert leads with greater impact.
