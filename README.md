# 👋 Hi, I'm Isa!

I have a background in Business Administration and Marketing, but I found my passion in tech. I started by managing SaaS communities and eventually fell in love with creating intuitive digital experiences. Now I’m a full-stack developer.

I enjoy building user-friendly, visually appealing solutions that turn data into real insights. Currently, I’m part of a tech team developing tools that help marketing teams attract and convert leads more effectively.
