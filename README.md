# 👋 Hi, I'm Isa!

As a JavaScript Full Stack developer, I bring ideas to life. 

I turn Figma designs into interactive web experiences with React. 
I also build backend services and APIs that keep sites fast, secure, and reliable.
And I document my work so teams can easily understand, maintain, and build on it. 

What drives me: continuous improvement. 
I love exploring new possibilities and leaving the product, the process, the code, and the users better than I found them!
