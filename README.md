# ðŸ‘‹ Hi! 
I'm Isadora Caputo, a marketer turned software developer. 

In 6 years as a digital marketer and 2 as a SaaS community manager, I've empowered users across different digital channels, turning their feedback into impactful strategies. My passion for connecting people through technology inspired my career transition into software development. After completing a full stack bootcamp at [CodeOp - Tech School for Women+](https://codeop.tech/), I joined their team as a teaching assistant, helping students code with advanced frameworks. As a full stack developer, I create efficient tech solutions, prioritize user needs, and advocate for diversity and inclusion. âœ¨

**Tech Stack:** JavaScript, Typescript, HTML, CSS, Next.js, React, Context API, Express.js, Node.js, Vite, MySql, Sequelize, DB-modeling, TDD, and Git.
