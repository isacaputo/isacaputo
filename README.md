My career has been driven by a genuine interest in understanding society's behavior. Over the course of 6 years, I have engaged with customers, blending creativity and problem-solving to nurture thriving relationships with them. Since 2019, I have been immersed in the tech industry, particularly in strengthening SaaS platform user communities. Recently, I enthusiastically transitioned my career into software development, aiming to efficiently translate user needs into customized tech solutions, and contribute to gender equity in tech.
