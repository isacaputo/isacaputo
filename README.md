# 👋 Hi! I'm Isadora Caputo, a marketer turned software developer.

With a background in Business Administration and Marketing, I bring a strategic perspective and strong communication skills to every project. My experience managing SaaS platform communities deepened my understanding of user behavior and digital engagement, which naturally led me to transition into software development. In this new role, I've translated my focus on the user into meaningful web experiences, and these experiences back into high-quality data.

I'm a full stack developer who enjoys frontend work and builds detail-oriented solutions. Currently, I'm part of a tech squad building tools that help marketing teams attract and convert leads with greater impact.
