👋 Hey there! I'm Isadora Caputo, an experienced SaaS community manager turned software developer. During 3 years, I nurtured global communities, boosted brand reputation, and assisted users worldwide. My passion for connecting people through technology inspired my career transition into software development. After completing a full stack development bootcamp at [CodeOp - Tech School for Women+](https://codeop.tech/), I joined their team as a teaching assistant, where I help students master programming using advanced tools and development frameworks. 

My mission extends beyond code; I am deeply committed to fostering community and gender equity in the tech industry. I create efficient and user-friendly tech solutions while advocating for diversity and inclusion. Join me on this exciting coding adventure! 🚀 #TechEnthusiast #CodeDeveloper #CommunityBuilder #DiversityInTech 🌐 ✨
